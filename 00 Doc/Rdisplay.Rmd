##Data
We imported our data into Tableau.

Our **dataset** is compiled of data from railroad employees and their sleep and activity patterns.
1) TBackground
2) TSleepAlert
3) TActivity

**Variable Definitions**
Here is a list of definitions for all the variables.

##Four Data Blending Visualizations

**Visualization 1** 
**Analysis**:  Although slight differences in sleep length at the low and high of each sleep quality, there appears to be a near 1 to 1 relation between sleep quality and sleep length regardless of sleep location.    
**Columns**:  Sleep Quality  
**Rows**: Sleep Location, AVG(Sleep Length)   
**Color**: CNT(Sleep Length)   
**Size**: CNT(Sleep Quality)   
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted sleep quality versus sleep location and average sleep length  
2. Colored by sleep length and size-organized by sleep quality  
3. Filtered by sleep location to get rid of the null values

**Visualization 2**   
**Analysis**: 1-3 cups of caffeine shows the highest average start/end alertness with the smallest drop in start to end alertness.    
**Columns**: Caffeine Amount    
**Rows**: AVG(Start Alertness), AVG(End Alertness)   
**Color**: CNT(Caffeine Amount)  
**Size**: Start/End Alertness  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted caffeine amount versus average start and end alertness levels  
2. Colored by sleep quality with the highest sleep quality being blue and lowest being red  
3. Filtered to remove null values

**Visualization 3** 
**Analysis**:  The overall stress levels drop after year 16, with number of employees decreasing as well.   
**Columns**: Years in present job  
**Rows**: AVG(Work Schedule), AVG(Job Security), AVG(Staffing)  
**Size**: CNT(Years in present job)  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted years present in job versus average work schedule, average job security, and average staffing  
2. Used sizze to discrimintate the count of the population present at each years in present job value

**Visualization 4**    
**Analysis**: Employees overall worked on average 40-59 hours a week.    
**Columns**: Age 
**Rows**: Weekly Work Hours  
**Size**: CNT(Age)  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted age versus weekly work hours
2. Weekly work hours variables were calculated by grouping

**Visualization 5**    
**Analysis**: Overview of factors that related to sleep quality  
**Columns**: Sleep Quality  
**Rows**: Measure Names  
**Color**: Measure Values  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted sleep quality versus measure names  
2. Filtered based off of sleep quality to get rid of the nulls  
3. Colored by measure values with 5 being the darkest and white being the lowest

**Visualization 6**    
**Analysis**: Time Spent per Activity  
**Columns**: ID Number  
**Rows**: Activity, AVG(Activity Time)  
**Color**: Activity  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted ID Number against activity type and average time spent doing each activity  
2. Colored by activity type  
3. Created a calculated field "activitytime" that subtracted end time from start time to get the total time for an activity. If the start time was later than the end time I had an if else statement to handle it: IF [Start Time (Activity)]>[End Time (Activity)] THEN 24 - [Start Time (Activity)] + [End Time (Activity)] ELSE [End Time (Activity)] - [Start Time (Activity)] END

**Visualization 7**    
**Analysis**: Time Spent per Activity version 2    
**Columns**: AVG(Activity Time)   
**Rows**: ID Number  
**Color**: Activity  
**Steps**:  
1. Plotted average activity time vs ID number  
2. Colored by activity type  
3. Labeled each activity type using a quick calculation (percent of total)  
4. Ordered by total activity time descending

**Visualization 8**    
**Analysis**: Group Analysis   
**Columns**: ID Number  
**Rows**: Falling Asleep, Sleep Quality, Sleep Length, Sleep Loss, Daily Caffeine
**Steps**:  
1. Used groups defined through visualization 7 and plotted against the various rows  
2. Filtered using those predefined groups

**Visualization 9**    
**Analysis**: Age Status per Job    
**Columns**: Job  
**Rows**: AVG(Age), AVG(Perceived Age)   
**Steps**:  
1. Job was listed as a dimension, so I had to make a separate graph for each position  
2. THe column was filtered to remove any null values  
3. Each row was labelled with it's respective value  
4. The separate graphs for each position were combined on the dashboard feature of Tableau

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/df_alertness_schedtype.R", echo= TRUE)
```

**Visualization 13**

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/df_sleep_joblength.R", echo= TRUE)

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/df_jobsecurity_yearsofservice.R", echo= TRUE)
```
